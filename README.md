# Breaking Bad's Quotes

This Single Page Application (SPA) was developed using the Clojure language and shows you different quotes of Breaking Bad's characters. 

For the development of the app, I used Re-frame (which is a ClojureScript framework for building user interfaces). 

The current source of the quotes is an external API. In version 2 of this project, I'm going to develop a backend using Luminus to source the quotes and provide other interesting characteristics (like getting quotes by author).
